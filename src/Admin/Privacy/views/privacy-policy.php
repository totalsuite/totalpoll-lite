<h3>Polls</h3>
<p>When visitors cast a vote on the poll we collect the data shown in the vote form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection and assure poll functionality.</p>
<p>If you have an account and you log in to this site and cast a vote, we will also collect your user ID.</p>
<p>If you cast a vote, the vote and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and count vote for each poll.</p>
